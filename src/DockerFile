# Step 1: Use an official Go image as the base image
FROM golang:1.20 as build

# Step 2: Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the go.mod and go.sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Step 4: Download all dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed
RUN go mod download

# Step 5: Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the Go app
RUN go build -o main .

# Step 7: Create a smaller image using a minimal base image
FROM debian:buster-slim

# Step 8: Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 9: Copy the pre-built binary file from the build image to this smaller image
COPY --from=build /app/main /app/

# Step 10: Expose the port on which the app will run (optional, depending on your app)
# EXPOSE 8080

# Step 11: Command to run the executable
CMD ["/app/main"]
